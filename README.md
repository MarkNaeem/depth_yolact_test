# depth_yolact_test

This repository contains the package that was used to demo and test the [depth_yolact_ros](https://github.com/MarkNaeem/depth_yolact_ros) package.

The two launch files in launch folder were used to recored the videos, one launches a gazebo simulation with random positioned people around a turtlebot3 (Burger model) with an Intel D435 camera on it. The second one is me sitting in front of a D435i camera showing the package working in realtime.
